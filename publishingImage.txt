Publishing a Docker image to Docker Hub involves several steps, including logging into Docker Hub, tagging the image, and pushing it to your Docker Hub repository. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker installed**: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. **Docker Hub account**: Sign up for an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

### Steps to Publish a Docker Image to Docker Hub

1. **Login to Docker Hub**: Use the `docker login` command to log in to your Docker Hub account.

    ```sh
    docker login
    ```

    You'll be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

2. **Build Your Docker Image**: If you haven't already built your Docker image, you can do so with the `docker build` command. Replace `your_image_name` with the name you want to give your image.

    ```sh
    docker build -t your_image_name .
    ```

3. **Tag the Docker Image**: Tag your Docker image with your Docker Hub username and the repository name. The format is `username/repository:tag`.

    ```sh
    docker tag your_image_name your_dockerhub_username/your_repository_name:tag
    ```

    Example:

    ```sh
    docker tag myapp johnsmith/myapp:latest
    ```
    docker tag my-express-app sudhaagarwal/my-express-app:latest

4. **Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub**: Use the `docker push` command to push your tagged image to Docker Hub.

    ```sh
    docker push your_dockerhub_username/your_repository_name:tag
    ```

    Example:

    ```sh
    docker push sudhaagarwal/my-express-app:latest
    ```

### Example Workflow

Here's a complete example workflow, assuming your Docker Hub username is `johnsmith`, your repository is `myapp`, and you're tagging the image as `latest`.

1. **Login to Docker Hub**:

    ```sh
    docker login
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:

    ```sh
    docker build -t myapp .
    ```

3. **Tag the Docker Image**:

    ```sh
    docker tag myapp johnsmith/myapp:latest
    ```

4. **Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub**:

    ```sh
    docker push johnsmith/myapp:latest
    ```

### Verify the Image on Docker Hub

After pushing, you can verify that your image is available on Docker Hub by visiting your Docker Hub repository page, which should be accessible at `https://hub.docker.com/r/your_dockerhub_username/your_repository_name`.

### Automating the Process

You can automate this process in a CI/CD pipeline, such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD. This involves adding the Docker build, tag, and push commands into your pipeline script.

To pull
